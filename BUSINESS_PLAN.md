# SMKlog Launch Business Plan (0 → First Qualified Leads)

## 1) Objective
Build a predictable pipeline of **qualified international logistics leads** for sale to freight forwarders, carriers, brokers, and 3PL firms.

## 2) Offer Design
- Core offer: monthly qualified lead packages by lane/service profile.
- Pilot offer (first 30 days): 10–25 qualified leads with strict filters.
- ICP buyers: SME/mid-market logistics firms with active sales teams and cross-border focus.

## 3) Positioning
- Trust-first, compliance-friendly lead generation.
- No unrealistic guarantees (no promised contract wins/revenue).
- Transparent qualification criteria and source tracking.

## 4) 30/60/90 Day Plan

## Days 1–30 (Foundation + First Validation)
- Finalize website and form pipeline.
- Set up analytics (GA4 + Search Console + conversion event on thank-you page).
- Launch LinkedIn company page and founder profile optimization.
- Start Google Ads Search with $40/day on high-intent keywords.
- Publish 6 LinkedIn authority posts (lanes, customs pain points, lead qualification tips).
- Daily outreach to 20 target logistics decision-makers.
- Goal: 8–15 qualified inbound conversations, 2 pilot proposals.

## Days 31–60 (Optimization + Proof)
- Improve landing page CVR via A/B tests (headline, CTA, form length).
- Add lane-specific pages/content snippets from search term data.
- Retarget site visitors on LinkedIn.
- Create 1-page case study format using pilot outcomes.
- Goal: 20–35 qualified leads delivered, 1–2 paying pilot clients.

## Days 61–90 (Scale)
- Segment campaigns by lane cluster (Asia→EU, MENA→EU, etc.).
- Add partner/referral motion (freight software consultants, trade associations).
- Build SOP-based lead QA pipeline and weekly client reporting cadence.
- Goal: 3–5 recurring clients, stable CPL and qualified-lead delivery process.

## 5) Budget (Starter)
- Google Ads: **$40/day** ≈ $1,200/mo
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (optional): $99/mo
- Creative/tools/automation: $100–250/mo
- Total starter range: **$1,300–$1,550/mo**

## 6) KPI Framework
- Website CVR (visit → form submit): target 2.5%–5%
- Lead qualification rate (submit → qualified): target 35%–55%
- Cost per qualified lead (CQL): initial target $45–$120 (lane dependent)
- Sales acceptance rate: >70%
- Time-to-first-response: <1 business day

## 7) Google Ads Starter Plan ($40/day)
Campaign type: Search only (Week 1–4)
- Campaign A: “logistics leads / freight forwarding leads”
- Campaign B: “international shipping clients / B2B shippers”
- Campaign C: lane-intent terms (import export freight service by region)

Execution rules:
- Phrase + exact match first; add negatives weekly.
- Geo targeting: regions tied to target lanes.
- Ad schedule: business hours + limited after-hours test.
- Extensions: sitelinks (Services, Regions, Quote), callout, structured snippets.
- Conversion event: thank-you page load + form submit.

## 8) LinkedIn Company Setup Plan
- Create page: SMKlog (banner, logo, clear one-line value proposition).
- Fill About with ICP + compliance-first statement.
- Add service pages: lane-focused lead generation.
- Publish 3 pinned proof posts:
  1) Qualification framework
  2) How lane-specific targeting works
  3) Pilot engagement structure
- Employee/Founder profile alignment:
  - Same headline/value proposition
  - CTA to quote page
  - Featured link to website

## 9) Organic LinkedIn Outreach Workflow
Daily SOP (Mon–Fri):
1. Build list of 20 prospects/day (Sales Director, Commercial Manager, BizDev Head).
2. Send personalized connection request (pain-point + lane relevance).
3. Day 2 follow-up: share short insight (not a hard pitch).
4. Day 4 follow-up: invite to a 15-minute fit call or pilot brief.
5. Tag outcomes in CRM: Connected / Replied / Qualified / Not-fit.

Message framework:
- Context line (role + lane relevance)
- Specific pain point (unqualified inbound, poor lane fit)
- Soft CTA (open to compare qualification criteria?)

## 10) SOPs
### SOP-A: Lead Intake QA
- Verify corporate email + company website
- Confirm lane + mode + shipment frequency
- Score fit (A/B/C) based on ICP and commercial readiness
- Push qualified lead packet to client within agreed SLA

### SOP-B: Weekly Reporting
- Leads generated
- Qualified leads delivered
- Top lanes and demand shifts
- Rejection reasons
- Next week optimization actions

### SOP-C: Compliance Review
- Check consent wording in forms
- Review outreach copy for non-deceptive claims
- Keep source logs and timestamped qualification notes

## 11) Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: High CPL on broad keywords
  - Mitigation: Tight match types, negatives, lane segmentation
- Risk: Low lead quality
  - Mitigation: Stricter form + manual QA scoring
- Risk: Low buyer trust
  - Mitigation: Transparent qualification policy, realistic claims, legal pages
