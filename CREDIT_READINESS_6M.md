# CREDIT_READINESS_6M

## Objective
Become lender-ready in 6 months with legal/compliant operations, clean documentation, and stable cashflow discipline.

## Core principles (non-negotiable)
- Legal entity and tax filings must be current.
- Business and personal finances separated.
- No fake invoices, fabricated revenue, or deceptive statements.
- Consistent bookkeeping and reconciliations monthly.
- Build real DSCR/cash buffer before applying for serious credit lines.

## Month-by-month roadmap

### Month 1 — Foundation & compliance
- Confirm legal structure, registrations, beneficial ownership records.
- Open/standardize business bank account(s) only for business activity.
- Set accounting stack (QuickBooks/Xero + receipt capture + monthly close cadence).
- Create document vault (cloud folders): legal, tax, banking, contracts, AR/AP.
- Start weekly cashflow dashboard.

**Deliverables:**
- Articles/incorporation docs, EIN/tax ID, operating agreement/bylaws
- Business licenses (if required)
- Last filed tax return(s)
- 3 months business bank statements (ongoing collection)

### Month 2 — Revenue quality and contracts
- Standardize client contracts/MSA + clear scope and payment terms.
- Move to invoice discipline (net terms, due reminders, late fee policy where legal).
- Track top 10 clients by revenue concentration risk.
- Build aged receivables report and collection process.

**Lender-facing metrics target:**
- AR >60 days under control (e.g., <15–20%)
- No unexplained cash deposits
- Documented recurring client base

### Month 3 — Margin and operating control
- Separate fixed vs variable costs.
- Set gross margin targets by service line.
- Reduce discretionary spend; document approvals over threshold.
- Begin monthly management reporting pack.

**Management pack should include:**
- P&L, balance sheet, cashflow statement
- AR/AP aging
- Revenue by client + by service lane
- Lead funnel metrics (MQL→SQL→client conversion)

### Month 4 — Credit profile build
- Check business credit bureau profiles (where applicable) and correct errors.
- Add 2–3 vendor tradelines that report (pay on time/early).
- Keep utilization conservative on any existing revolving credit.
- Maintain on-time payment record across vendors/taxes/payroll.

**Target behavior:**
- Zero late payments
- Revolving utilization ideally <30%
- Positive monthly operating cash trend

### Month 5 — Underwriting prep
- Build 12-month realistic forecast (base, conservative, stress case).
- Prepare debt capacity view (what payment level business can safely carry).
- Compile lender packet draft and gap list.
- Simulate lender Q&A (customer concentration, churn, seasonality, compliance risk).

**Lender packet draft:**
- 12–24 months bank statements
- 2 years tax returns (if available)
- YTD financials + prior-year comparison
- AR/AP aging reports
- Top customer/contracts summary
- Ownership/ID docs

### Month 6 — Apply strategically
- Approach 2–4 lender types in order:
  1) Existing bank relationship
  2) Credit union / community bank
  3) Fintech working capital option (compare APR and covenants)
- Request right-sized facility (avoid max leverage).
- Negotiate terms: covenants, personal guarantee scope, fees, prepayment penalties.
- Keep fallback runway plan if facility delayed.

## Risk controls lenders care about
- **Concentration risk:** no single client dominating revenue excessively.
- **Collections risk:** disciplined AR follow-up and low delinquency.
- **Operational risk:** documented SOPs and backup ownership for key processes.
- **Compliance risk:** privacy/marketing consent records, proper contracting, tax timeliness.
- **Cash risk:** minimum operating reserve (e.g., 2–3 months core expenses target over time).

## Cashflow discipline checklist (weekly)
- 13-week rolling cash forecast updated every week
- AR calls/reminders schedule executed
- Payables prioritized by criticality + due date
- Pause non-core spend when forecast coverage drops
- Owner draws controlled and pre-planned (no random withdrawals)

## Metrics to hit before serious credit ask
- 6+ months clean bookkeeping consistency
- Positive or improving operating cashflow trend
- Stable gross margin profile
- On-time tax/payroll/vendor payments
- Credible forecast tied to pipeline + signed clients

## RU-friendly (кратко)
- За 6 месяцев цель: «чистый» бизнес для банка, без серых схем.
- База: раздельные финансы, регулярный бухучет, порядок в договорах и налогах.
- Ежемесячно: улучшать AR/маржу/кэш-флоу, собирать полный пакет документов.
- Кредит брать поэтапно и в адекватном размере, с контролем рисков и подушкой ликвидности.
