# 2026-02-10

- Donny accepted SMKlog homepage v12 visual direction ("Нормально, мне нравится") and approved using that style as the base for the full site.
- Published accepted site version to GitHub Pages root and kept preview available.
  - Production/root: https://smklog.github.io/tony/
  - Preview: https://smklog.github.io/tony/preview/?v=12
- Donny asked to stop 15-minute website progress alerts; recurring 15-min cron was removed.
- Donny requested strict execution style: fewer status chats, more concrete artifacts.
- Donny asked for voice-first interaction convenience; current session cannot reliably transcribe inbound voice automatically yet (needs proper voice pipeline setup later).
- Donny approved: next immediate priority is HubSpot form connection/testing first, without domain migration and without CRM/domain transfer coupling.
- Current HubSpot setup status: user is inside Forms builder UI and needs to publish form + share embed code (or form URL/portalId+formId) so integration can be completed.
- Domain cutover is currently blocked by missing local Cloudflare credentials file in workspace (`secrets/cloudflare.env` not present).
- Reminder created for Donny: McNugget order reminder at 11:55 AM EST (5 minutes before 12:00 PM EST drop) for 2026-02-10.
