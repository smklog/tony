# LEAD_BUYER_PLAYBOOK

## ICP: who to sell logistics leads to first

## Priority segments (ranked)
1. **Mid-size freight forwarders** (20–200 staff) expanding lanes
2. **Customs brokers** adding managed transport services
3. **3PLs / warehousing operators** with outbound sales teams
4. **Asset-light NVOCC / consolidators** needing predictable top-of-funnel
5. **Carrier commercial teams** during capacity-soft periods

## Buyer personas
### 1) Head of Sales / Commercial Director
- Pain: inconsistent pipeline, poor lead quality, reps wasting time.
- Trigger: growth target without proportional SDR hiring.

### 2) Branch Manager / Country Manager
- Pain: local team under target, pressure on monthly revenue.
- Trigger: opening new corridor or vertical.
- Winning message: "Pilot in one lane, measure SQL and conversion before scale."

### 3) Founder / GM (SME logistics firm)
- Pain: sales depends on owner network/referrals.
- Trigger: wants repeatable acquisition system.
- Winning message: "Build predictable pipeline without over-hiring sales ops."

## Scripts
### Cold email (short)
Subject: New shipper demand for {{lane}} (qualified, not scraped)

Hi {{Name}},

We help logistics teams get qualified shipper opportunities filtered by lane, mode, shipment frequency, and timeline.

If useful, I can share a 30-day pilot scope for {{Company}} focused on {{lane/region}} with transparent qualification criteria.

Worth a quick 15-minute call next week?

— {{Your Name}}

### LinkedIn message
Hi {{Name}}, quick one — we run qualified lead programs for forwarders/3PLs, with clear filters (lane, mode, timeline, buyer intent) and CRM-ready handoff.

If {{Company}} is expanding {{lane/vertical}}, I can send a concise pilot outline.

### Discovery call opener
"Before we discuss volume, I want to align on quality. Which lead attributes are non-negotiable for your team (lane, cargo, timeline, buyer role, budget readiness)?"

## Objection handling
- "We tried leads before, quality was poor."
  - Response: "Understood. We define disqualification rules first and review quality weekly with call outcomes. No blind list drops."
- "Can you guarantee shipment wins?"
  - Response: "No ethical provider can guarantee wins. We guarantee transparent qualification process and measurable funnel metrics."
- "Too expensive."
  - Response: "Let’s compare against cost per SQL and rep time saved, not raw cost per contact."

## 90-day sales cadence
- Month 1: build target list (100 accounts), launch outbound, close 2–3 pilots
- Month 2: optimize targeting from call outcomes, add one vertical specialization
- Month 3: productize best-performing pilot template and upsell existing pilots

## RU-friendly (кратко)
- Кому продавать сначала: экспедиторы, брокеры, 3PL среднего размера.
- Продавать не «контакты», а пилот с KPI: встречи, SQL, цена за SQL.
- Скрипт: короткий, про конкретные направления и фильтры качества.
- Возражения закрывать через прозрачный процесс и метрики, а не обещания «гарантированных сделок».
